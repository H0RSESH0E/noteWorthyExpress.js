## Installation
Clone the repo, initialize the same folder for npm packages and install the dependencies, then start the server with the command "node server" before opening http:\\localhost:3001 in your preferred browser. Or visit the application on the web at https://note-worthy-express.herokuapp.com/  
&nbsp;  
## Usage
The application is not yet functional online because the Heroku server has an "Ephemeral Disk" and files will not persist between browser sessions.
